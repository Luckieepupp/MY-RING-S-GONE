                <h2>Sorry, my ring</h2>
                <p><strong>Date:</strong> October 27, 2024</p>
                <p>After my lunch and sitting back my seat in library, I suddenly found my ring is gone. That was the present my mom gave to me.</p>
		<p>I was shocked and had no idea what to do. I was not such sorrow, however, as I thought I would be. In fact, what was full of my heart was the feeling like "this day eventually comes", and a strong sense of guilty. </p>
		<p>It was beautiful ring. I said I really liked it. But it seems that I didn't treasure it like what I said. It was always on my fingers. It was treated by me as just a symbol of me. </p>
		<p>I am so guilty, for my dishonesty, selfishness and carelessness.</p>
		<p>Even my guilty, I feel that guilty is just like a kind of hypocrisy. I feel disgusted to myself. 因为迟来的深情真的很贱。</p>
		<p>Another thing I've learned is that when you feel something is not very suitable for, or not comfortable to you as it was in the past. Don't hesitate paying attention to it. If necessary, change this condition immeadiately. It doesn't mean that you discard it, or you're cold or indifferent. Instead, if you truly treasure or love it, you won't enforce it to be with you. You may change and adapt the new condition.</p>
		<p>The same as my ring. I should have put it back to the jewellery case when I found I was no longer fit for it. I was thinner than the past then and my finger was too. It was all my fault.</p>
		<p>I lost it. And I lost him.</p>
		<p>Thanks for staying with me for about 14 months. Thanks for bearing my all carelessness.</p>
		<p>每当我看到戒指留在手指上的那一圈印记，就像看到了遗物一样。而即使是这圈印记，不久之后也会消失。</p>
